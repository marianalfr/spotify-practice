### Getting started

If you want to play around with my project, please visit [my Github repository](https://github.com/marianalfr/spotify-practice) to clone or download it.
* To clone it: copy this [link](https://github.com/marianalfr/spotify-practice.git) and go to your terminal. Once on the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to install it and use the command:

```$ git clone https://github.com/marianalfr/spotify-practice.git```

* To download it: you can download the zip version using the clone or download tab on the repository and unzip it in your local directory.


### Installing

* On your terminal, make sure you are in your *spotify-practice* folder and run the commands:

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start` or `$ gulp`

* Gulp will create the `public`folder and will run a local server where any changes will immediately show.
* You can also create a `docs`folder by running `gulp docs`on your terminal.


### Technologies

* HTML 5.
* CSS - SCSS.
